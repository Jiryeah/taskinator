# Summary

Taskinator is an application that allows the user to dynamically add tasks that they wish to fulfill. Through DOM manipulation and Web API use, we are able to accomplish this and also ensure that the data remains on the page even after a refresh. 

## Usage
Created as the in-class project at UTSA to teach Web API uses and features.
